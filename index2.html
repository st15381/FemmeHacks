	<h3>The Reality of Women in STEM</h3>

<div class="visible" id="home">
	
	<h4>What is STEM?</h4>
	<p>STEM refers to a field of careers involving the use of problem solving and critical/ analytical thinking. This is applied to the areas of science (S), technology (T), engineering (E), and mathematics (M). Essentially, STEM is a web of different fields of careers incorporating these aspects.
	</p>
	<h4>STEM fields build off each other.</h4>
	<p>Intersectionality is a huge aspect of STEM and often the different branches interact and apply to each other. You can see this in fields such as medicine where doctors, who generally have science backgrounds, are using machines coded and built by people from both the technology and engineering branches of STEM. This can lead to advances in these three divisions, even though the origin was in the mathematical field. </p>
	<h4>We interact with STEM everyday.</h4>
	<p>Some examples of careers in the STEM field include:
	<ul> physicians</ul>
	<ul> computer engineers</ul>
	<ul> actuaries</ul>
	<ul> staticians</ul> 

	<h4>Women in STEM</h4>
	<p>It isnâ€™t difficult to see the importance and practicality in careers in the STEM field. It should be beneficial then to have diverse employees in such fields in order to create the enhance the application of products and services to the population; yet, when looking at the involvement of varying genders, there is one glaring pattern: women are not are present in these fields as men.</p>

	<img id="info2" src="http://lastema.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/STEM-jobs.png">

	<p>Another aspect that is important to keep in mind when thinking of women's involvement in STEM, is women of color and their involvement in STEM. Often minority groups are overlooked when creating programs aimed at integrating women into STEM fields.</p>

	<h4>What is science and what do scientists do?</h4>
	<p>Science is the study of the natural world and the living things surrounding us.
	Scientists observe both the physical and natural aspects of the world by researching, observing, sampling, experimenting, analyzing.
<h4>Description of scientific careers </h4>
<p>Common careers in the science field include: astronomers, biochemists, physicians, physicists, veterinarians, zoologists, just to name a few!

	<h2>Engineering.</h2>
	<h4>What is engineering?</h4>
	<p>Engineering is a category of science in which design, construction, technology, machines and structure is integrated together in order to form an application of the combined to solve problems and create practical articles.</p>
	<h4>Careers.</h4>
	<p>Popular careers in the field of engineering include web developer, one who creates and upkeeps web pages; civil engineers, those who strategize and oversee the building of tunnels, roads, bridges and other architectural structures; and computer programmers, those who arrange the codes in order for computers to process and interpret data.</p>

	<h2>Mathematics.</h2>
	<h4>What is mathematics?</h4>
	<p>Mathematics is the science that analyzes the reasoning and rationality of shapes, amount of an object or substance, and arrangement of numbers and patterns.</p>
	<h4>Careers.</h4>
	<p>Common jobs in the field of mathematics are stockbrokers, those who implement and manage the sales and trading of stocks and bonds; accountants, those who manage and assist businesses in their financial ventures; and actuaries, a person who helps to aid in the planning of financial endeavors in the case of a tragedy or misfortune.</p>

	<h4>Education.</h4>
	<p>Education is important in setting a foundation not just for knowledge but for interest. It is common for young girls to have an interest in STEM topics but push those interests aside in high school. </p>
	<p>Hope's INFORGRAPHIC OF EDUCATION</p> 
	<p>A great way to keep the interest of young girls is to keep them excited about STEM fields and help tear down the stigma of STEM being a men only world.  </p>
