	<h3>The Reality of Women in STEM</h3>

<div class="visible" id="home">
	
	<h4>What is STEM?</h4>
	<p>STEM refers to a field of careers involving the use of problem solving and critical/ analytical thinking. This is applied to the areas of science (S), technology (T), engineering (E), and mathematics (M). Essentially, STEM is a web of different fields of careers incorporating these aspects.
	</p>
	<h4>STEM fields build off each other.</h4>
	<p>Intersectionality is a huge aspect of STEM and often the different branches interact and apply to each other. You can see this in fields such as medicine where doctors, who generally have science backgrounds, are using machines coded and built by people from both the technology and engineering branches of STEM. This can lead to advances in these three divisions, even though the origin was in the mathematical field. </p>
	<h4>We interact with STEM everyday.</h4>
	<p>Some examples of careers in the STEM field include:
	<ul> physicians</ul>
	<ul> computer engineers</ul>
	<ul> actuaries</ul>
	<ul> staticians</ul> 

	<h4>Women in STEM</h4>
	<p>It isnâ€™t difficult to see the importance and practicality in careers in the STEM field. It should be beneficial then to have diverse employees in such fields in order to create the enhance the application of products and services to the population; yet, when looking at the involvement of varying genders, there is one glaring pattern: women are not are present in these fields as men.</p>

	<img id="info2" src="http://lastema.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/STEM-jobs.png">

	<p>Another aspect that is important to keep in mind when thinking of women's involvement in STEM, is women of color and their involvement in STEM. Often minority groups are overlooked when creating programs aimed at integrating women into STEM fields.</p>

	<h1>Technology.</h1>
	<h4>What is technology and how is it significant?</h4>
	<p> Technology uses math, science, and engineering to communicate certain ideas, expressions, messgaes, and details. There are
many different types of communication that can be learned through education of computer science, a major aspect of technology. In computer science especially, creativity is essential to developing ideas and communticating efficently. By creating, analyzing and replicating code, there is no limit to what we can create. <p>

	<h4>Description of common careers in the tech industry</h4>
	<p> Common careers in modern technology include: 
	web developers</ul> 
	<ul>computer programmers</ul> 
	<ul>database administrators</ul>
	<ul>data analysists</ul>

	<h4>Education.</h4>
	<p>Education is important in setting a foundation not just for knowledge but for interest. It is common for young girls to have an interest in STEM topics but push those interests aside in high school. </p>
	<p>Hope's INFORGRAPHIC OF EDUCATION</p> 
	<p>A great way to keep the interest of young girls is to keep them excited about STEM fields and help tear down the stigma of STEM being a men only world.  </p>
